# Concatenate

Two or more arrays can be concatenated together using the concatenate function with a tuple of the arrays to be joined:

Task

You are given two integer arrays of size N X P and M X P(N & M are rows, and P is the column). Your task is to concatenate the arrays along axis .

Input Format

The first line contains space separated integers N, M and P. 
The next N lines contains the space separated elements of the P columns. 
After that, the next M lines contains the space separated elements of the P columns.

Output Format

Print the concatenated array of size (N+M) X P.





code with python3:


import numpy
N,M,P = map(int, input().split())  # read more than one values with map() function
array_1 = numpy.array([input().strip().split() for _ in range(N)], int)
array_2 = numpy.array([input().strip().split() for _ in range(M)], int)
print(numpy.concatenate((array_1, array_2), axis = 0))
